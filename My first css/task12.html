    <h2>speak to Cadiz</h2>
    <p id="blog">A few days before my boat was due to sail from Santander, I set off to cover the 100km from Tarifa to Cadiz. It was a relatively easy route. No major steep climbs and the main road had a good hard shoulder. It did take me a while to find the road adjacent to the motorway, but once on it, I pretty much had it to myself.</p>
    <p class="bold">The next difficult section was trying to pick up the cycle path to Cadiz out of Chiclana de la Fronteria to avoid the motorway.<p>
        <p id="blog">The cycle path I followed from the town centre led me right to the start of the motorway. I eventually found a place to cross the railway and get onto the cycle path to Cadiz. The sign posting was non-existant.</p> 
        <p>However once on the path, I loved it. Alongside a huge wetland, it was a bird paradise. Flamingos, spoonbills, various waders and some raptors.</p>
